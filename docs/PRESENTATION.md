## Slide 2: Problem and Motivation

**The Problem:**
Citizen grievance reporting is currently **fragmented, slow, and unresponsive**. Users face complex forms, lack of transparency, and language barriers (e.g., non-English speakers). Authorities struggle with duplicate reports and lack of prioritized data.

**Motivation:**
- **Who benefits?** Citizens (easy reporting), Municipalities (cleaned data), Society (faster fixes).
- **Gaps:** Existing apps lack **real-time verification**, **multi-lingual support**, and **automated severity filtering**.
- **Our Goal:** To democratize civic reporting using AI, making it accessible even to those who cannot type, through Voice and WhatsApp.

## Slide 5: Implementation and Results

**What We Built:**
A fully functional **PWA (Progressive Web App)** with:
- **✅ Live Camera Analysis:** Detects "Fire" or "Potholes" instantly.
- **✅ Bilingual Input:** "Yahan aag lagi hai" -> Recognized as Fire Emergency.
- **✅ Gamification:** Users earn "Karma Points" for verified reports.
- **✅ Dark Mode UI:** Premium, battery-saving aesthetics.

**Proof of Execution:**

## Slide 6: Conclusion and Future Scope

**Conclusion:**
SAAAF successfully demonstrates how **GenAI** can streamline civic governance. We reduced reporting time from **minutes to seconds** and added accessibility for millions of non-English speakers.

**Future Scope:**
1.  **Integration:** Connect APIs directly with Municipal Corporation (MCD/BMC).
2.  **IoT Integration:** Auto-detect issues via smart city sensors.
3.  **Offline Mode:** Report via SMS for low-connectivity areas.
4.  **Blockchain:** Immutable record of grievances for transparency.
